# Fixed Effects and Random Effects Modelling

## Overview

This project explores Fixed Effects and Random Effects modelling to understand how structured variability across entities or groups can be incorporated into statistical analysis.

Rather than assuming uniform behavior across observations, these models allow us to account for differences that arise due to group-specific characteristics and inherent variability. Fixed effects capture constant group-level influences, while random effects model variability across entities drawn from a larger population.

## Motivation

In many real-world datasets, observations are not independent — they are often grouped by subjects, organizations, time periods, or environments.

Traditional regression models may fail to capture:

- Hidden group-specific behavior  
- Unobserved heterogeneity  
- Variability across entities  

This notebook investigates how fixed and random effects help address these limitations by explicitly modeling structured differences across groups.

## What This Project Covers

- Understanding fixed effects modelling  
- Understanding random effects modelling  
- Comparing constant vs varying group-level influences  
- Modeling variability across clustered observations  

---

## Key Idea

Fixed effects focus on estimating group-specific characteristics that remain constant, while random effects account for variability across entities within a larger population.

Together, these approaches allow:

- Control for unobserved heterogeneity  
- Better modeling of grouped or longitudinal data  
- More realistic representation of structured variability

## Outcome

Demonstrates how incorporating fixed and random effects enables richer statistical modeling by accounting for both constant group influences and inherent variability across observations.
